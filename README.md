# Artemis

Artemis -- stateful processing framework for administrative data powered by Apache Arrowâ„¢.

# Build & Deploy

To build Artemis, simply call the shell script package.sh with the argument `-d` to create a directory to dump the resulting archive file to.

Example: `bash package.sh -d test_build`

Artemis deployment is handled via setup.sh. You must supply the version (with the format artemis-x.y.z) and the type of installation, unpack or setup.

Example: `bash setup.sh -t unpack -v artemis-0.0.1`

# Development environment
Following uses pyenv for python version management.

cd <workdir>
pyenv local <pyenv version>

To see the list of pyenv environments
pyenv version

python -m venv <workdir>
source bin/activate
git clone https://gitlab.k8s.cloud.statcan.ca/stcdatascience/artemis.git
cd artemis
python setup.py install


# Building the protobuf
Artemis metadata is defined in io/protobuf/artemis.proto. An important component
of the metadata are histograms. Histograms are provided by the physt package
which includes io functionality to/from protobuf. However, the proto file is
not distributed with the package. This requires building the protobuf with
a copy of the histogram.proto class. 

To build (from the io/protobuf directory)

'''bash
protoc -I=./ --python_out=./ ./artemis.proto
'''

After, modify the python code:

'''bash
import histogram_pb2 as histogram_pb2
'''

to

'''bash
import physt.io.protobuf.histogram_pb2 as histogram_pb2
'''
