Developers Guide
################

Development environment
=======================

.. code:: bash

  mkdir <workspace>
  cd <workspace>
  git clone https://github.com/artemis-analytics/artemis.git
  git clone https://github.com/artemis-analytics/fwfr.git
  conda env create -f artemis/environment.yaml
  conda activate artemis-dev
  cd fwfr
  ./install.sh --source
  cd ../artemis
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace install
  python -m unittest


Build & Deploy
==============

To build Artemis, cd to the root of the artemis repository. Follow the instructions below.

.. code:: bash

  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate artemis-dev
  git clone "FWFR GIT REPO"
  conda install conda-build
  conda build conda-recipes -c conda-forge
  mv "PATH TO CONDA"/envs/artemis-dev/conda-bld/broken/artemis-"VERSION".tar.bz2 ./
  conda deactivate
  bash release/package.sh -e artemis-dev -n artemis-pack -p artemis-"VERSION" -r "PATH TO ARTEMIS REPO"

This will result in a package called "artemis-pack.tar.gz". You can move this to anywhere you wish to 
deploy.

You can install the created package file with the "deploy.sh" script. 

.. code:: bash

  bash deploy.sh -e "NAME OF CONDA ENV TO CREATE" -n "NAME OF PACKAGE FILE" -p "NAME OF PACKAGE"


Contributing
============
Before committing new branches to GitHub, start a new issue. Several labels are available 
to identify the area of work in the project. 

Use the following naming for branches
<feature_or_bug>-<label>-<issue>


Artemis Release and Tag Management
==================================

During a new Artemis release, the commit that will be released needs to be
tagged with the new version tag, of the format X.Y.Z.
- X is a major version, and should only be incremented when major features are added to Artemis.
- Y is a minor version, it should be incremented when minor features are added to Artemis.
When a new X version is released, Y is returned to 0.
- Z is a fix version, it should be incremented when releases for Artemis are only to fix bugs
or correct small errors. When a new X or Y version is released, Z is returned to 0.

It is important to update the setup.py file with the new Artemis version.


Building the Protobuf
=====================

Requires the protoc compiler from google.

Artemis metadata is defined in io/protobuf/artemis.proto. An important component
of the metadata are histograms. Histograms are provided by the physt package
which includes io functionality to/from protobuf. However, the proto file is
not distributed with the package. This requires building the protobuf with
a copy of the histogram.proto class.

To build (from the io/protobuf directory)

.. code:: bash

  protoc -I=./ --python_out=./ ./artemis.proto
