Welcome to pyartemis's documentation!

The *Artemis* data science framework is a record batch based data processing framework,
powered by Apache Arrow open source data format standard, for the production of high-quality, 
fit-for-analysis, tabular, structured data for analytical purposes. The
framework at the core relies on the well-defined, cross-lanaguage, Apache Arrow
data format that accelerates analytical processing of the data on modern computing
architecture and ensures data integrity thoughout the data lifecycle (ingestion, integration, 
management, processing, and analysis). The increasing volume and velocity of data, the need 
for automation, machine learning and efficient processing is changing analytical workloads. 
Artemis supports ffficient iteration on the data at any stage in the data life cycle, and statistical tools
for continous data quality and fit-for-use assessement.
