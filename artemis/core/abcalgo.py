    Logger for the Base class and each derived class.
    Not for instances though
    To identify logging from different configurations
    pass the instance name (attribute)

        # Logger name derived accounting for inheritance for the bonus marks
        # Combining the Mixins and base classes,
        # the naming is convenient for the logging
